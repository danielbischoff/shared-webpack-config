# shared-webpack-config
No more copying of webpack config files. Create a single, shareable webpack config project.

The projects are just examples for my wiki tutortial. Please read the wiki so that you can build your own, custom, shareable build config!

[https://github.com/danielbischoff/shared-webpack-config/wiki](https://github.com/danielbischoff/shared-webpack-config/wiki)

This project contains two examples. One example uses typescript and the other example uses babel to transpile to javascript. Checkout the subfolder you prefer!

## How to run
```shell
git clone https://github.com/danielbischoff/shared-webpack-config.git
cd shared-webpack-config
cd js-babel # or cd typescript
yarn install
cd app
yarn start # starts a dev server at port 9000
```
